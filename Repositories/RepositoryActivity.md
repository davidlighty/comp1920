Repository Activity
===================

An important part of using any Repository is to understand what is happening with it, what is it status.  The following sections will describe and show these different parts.

GitHub Start Page
-----------------

The starting section of a repository on Github.  Always have a readme file, usually in "Markdown" style (readme.md).  This file will be automatically shown to all visitors and is a good way to comminucate what the repository is about/achieving.

* User/Repository Name
* Title/Desctiption
* Repository Stats
	* Number of Commits
	* Number of branches
	* Number of releases

Network Activity
----------------

Shows the activity of this repository across forks and contributors.

* Graph
	Shows the branch activity of this project, from the master main branch through all the forks of the main branch.  "Pull Requests" that are accepted are shown as arrows coming back into the master branch.

	
	* Common issue with branches show here are most are all called "master", when in fact there is only one master branch.  And all others are siblings or children branches.  But you could "seperate" the branch and make it your own, thereby becoming the "master" of your new branch (also called a fork).
